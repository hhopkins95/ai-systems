# Index Document Template

Use this template for folder index files that provide navigation.

---

```markdown
# [Folder Name]

[One sentence describing what documentation lives here.]

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Doc Name](doc-name.md) | [What you'll learn / when to read] |
| [Another Doc](another.md) | [What you'll learn / when to read] |

## Where to Start

- **[Situation 1]**: Read [Doc A](doc-a.md)
- **[Situation 2]**: Read [Doc B](doc-b.md)

## Related

- [Other folder](../other/) - [What's there and when you'd need it]
```

---

## Usage Notes

- Keep the description brief—one sentence
- Contents table should have helpful descriptions, not just titles
- "Where to Start" helps readers with different goals find the right doc
- Every folder with more than one file should have an index
